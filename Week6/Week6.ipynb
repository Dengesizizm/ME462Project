Then, our aim is obtaining the equality $C(s)=R(s)$. $D(s)$ is the disturbance input acts on the plant, which is out of our control. Therefore, to obtain $C(s)=R(s)$ we should cancel the effect of the disturbance on the plant. For this purpose, the estimated value of the disturbance is given as input to the controller, which is $D^*(s)$.\n",

Now, let's use the transfer function algebra to understand how you can determine the controller's transfer functions.\n",

Therefore, we should change the controller transfer function to obtain $R(s)=C(s)$, rather than maximizing the $K$ value. In the next weeks, we will learn what is required from the controller to obtain zero steady-state error $R(s)=C(s)$ or keeping the output value in the small error margin $R(s)\\approx C(s)$.\n",
