        " Then.. What are the sources of errors in our system? Before that, lets get familiar with the ***actuator*** & ***controller*** of our system. *Actuator* is the thing that provides the action needed for system to work. In our case, electric motor inside your RC car is the *actuator* of the system. A ***controller*** a device which adjusts the inputs of the system to achieve desired performance of the system. The controller of your system is a controller circuit board placed in our RC car.\n",

By using the distance value, controller decides rotation time and rotational speed of the *actuator*, which is the electric motor of the RC car. Then, DC motor provides motion determined by a *controller*. Finally, RC car, which is the *plant* of the system, takes distance we measured as an *output*. \n",
