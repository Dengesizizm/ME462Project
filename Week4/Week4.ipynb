Moreover, you can use your knowledge for modeling more complex systems that include multiple types of these systems such as DC or hydraulic servo motors. Since you know the Laplace transform, you can obtain the desired transfer functions of these systems for controller design. In the next weeks Notebook, we will look at some examples of these kind of applications before starting to basic features of the control systems.\n",
