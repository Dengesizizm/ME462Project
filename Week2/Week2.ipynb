        "* The RC car was our ***plant***.\n",
        "* The distance we wanted our RC car to travel was our ***input***.\n",
        "* The measured distance, on the other hand, was our ***output***.\n",
        "* The difference between *input* and *output* was our ***error*** of the system. With this error value, we can determine how successful our control system operates.\n",
        "* An electric motor was our ***actuator*** which actuates our *plant* depending on the incoming electrical signals.\n",
        "* A controller circuit board was our ***controller*** which takes the *input* (or the *error* in *closed loop* case) and sends the electrical signals to the *actuator*.\n",
        "* The strong wind affecting the motion of our RC car was our ***disturbance*** of the plant.<br/>\n",
