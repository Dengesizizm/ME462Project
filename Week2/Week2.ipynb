        "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's solve the feedback loop part shown with $X$ and $Z$ now. We have an equation like:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$Z = G_1  G_2  E$$\n",
        "\n",
        "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where;\n",
        "\n",
        "$$E = X - H_1  Z \\\\\n",
        "Z = G_1 G_2 (X - H_1 Z) \\\\\n",
        "Z (1 + G_1 G_2 H_1) = G_1 G_2 X\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore we get the required transfer function as shown in red below:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$Z = \\frac{{\\color{red}{G_1 G_2}}}{{\\color{red}{1 + G_1 G_2 H_1}}} X$$\n",
        "\n",
        "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the $K$ and $M$ part, we can slide the feedback line forward to the point $M$. As we can see:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$M = G_5 K$$\n",
        "\n",
        "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we know that the feedback at the summing point is equal to $K H_2$. If we slide the feedback line to $M$ point, this should not change. The new feedback becomes $M H_2$ which is equals to $K G_5 H_2$. Then, we need to divide the transfer function on the feedback with $G_5$. The equivalent block diagram can be shown below:\n",
        "\n",
        "<center><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dengesizizm/ME462Project/master/Week2/Figures/BD_Algebra/BD_Algebra_4.png\" width=\"600\"></center><br/>\n",
        "\n",
        "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, we can do the same simplification in this red part, that we first made like this:\n",
        "\n",
        "<center><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dengesizizm/ME462Project/master/Week2/Figures/BD_Algebra/BD_Algebra_5.png\" width=\"600\"></center><br/>\n",
        "\n",
        "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the feedback loop between points $Z$ and $Y$ we apply the same steps at the feedback loop between $X$ and $Z$.\n",
        "\n",
        "$$Y = (G_3 + G_4) G_5 (Z - H_3 Y) \\\\\n",
        "Y(1 + (G_3 + G_4) G_5 H_3) = (G_3 + G_4) G_5 Z \\\\\n",
        "Y = \\frac{{\\color{red}{(G_3 + G_4) G_5}}}{{\\color{red}{1 + (G_3 + G_4) G_5 H_3}}} Z$$\n",
        "\n",
        "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we have:\n",
        "\n",
        "<center><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dengesizizm/ME462Project/master/Week2/Figures/BD_Algebra/BD_Algebra_6.png\" width=\"600\"></center><br/>\n",
        "\n",
        "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similar to previous steps, we can continue reducing our block diagram with these steps:\n",
