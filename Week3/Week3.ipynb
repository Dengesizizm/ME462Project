        "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome back to Control Systems Notebook! The topic of this week is the mathematical modeling of physical systems. Let's start with what mathematical modeling is. Simply, it is a description of a system using mathematical concepts and language, such as algebra or calculus. Mathematical models help us to study the effects of different components on the system and to make predictions about its behavior. We will begin modeling with mechanical systems, which you are quite familiar with it.\n",
