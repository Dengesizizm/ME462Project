|   3   | Mathematical modeling. Translational mechanical systems. Rotational mechanical Systems. Transforming mechanical elements. Rotational systems with gear box. Rules for drawing detailed block diagrams. | 10-14 |  Last week but with torsional spring and damping |
|   4   | Electrical systems. Operational Amplifiers. Fluid systems. Thermal Systems. Hybrid systems. | 15-24 | Pression for the governor system to be produced by a curcuit and piston.  |
|   5   | Transducing elements. Hydraulic actuator. Two examples on hydro-mechanical systems. DC servomotor. Electromechanical systems and hydraulic servomotor. | 25-27 |  Just colab  |
|   6   | Basic features of Control Systems. Open loop systems. Open loop thermal system. Closed loop systems. Some common controller types. Combined systems. Servo characteristics. Regulator characteristics. Sensitivity analysis. DC servomotor. | 28-39 | a vehicle that is required to stay on a point in a line (1 dimension motion) with wind. Succes with both open (with Steady, foreseen wind) and closed (with random wind) loops are shown, user is free to wander the code (as always :) ) |
|   7   | General requirements for a control system. Time response of LTI systems. Impulse response. Characteristic polynomial. Characteristic equation. Poles and zeros of a transfer function. | 39-47 |  7th week but with more plots :), can be joined into one week. |
|   8   | Stability definitions and theorems. Asymptotic stability. Marginal stability. Instability. Hurwitz criterion. Routh criterion. Stability margin. | 47-53 |  Stability, marginal stability and instability of a line follower robot's angular position are asked to be observed (with self set PID values), real time plots are provided |
|   9   | Steady state error analysis. Final Value Theorem. Methods to improve steady state characteristics of control systems. | 54-61|  Steady state characteristics are to be observed at week 8's setup (on a straight line)  |
|   10  | Step response of first order systems. Zero and nonzero To cases. Initial Value Theorem. Step response of second order systems. Overdamped systems. Critically damped systems. Underdamped and undamped systems. | 62-71 |   |
