|   1   | Course Policy. Introduction. Basic Concepts and Definitions. Types of Control. Open loop versus closed loop control, direct versus indirect control.| 1-4 | Colab, explanation of how the assignement system will work, introduction to Python Control Systems Library  |
|   2   | Input/Output (I/O) relations. Laplace transforms. Transfer functions. Block diagrams. Block Diagram Algebra. | 5-9   |  [Centrifugal governor system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrifugal_governor) (equations are provided, taking laplace is needed)  |
|   3   | Mathematical modeling. Translational mechanical systems. Rotational mechanical Systems. Transforming mechanical elements. Rotational systems with gear box. Rules for drawing detailed block diagrams. | 10-14 |  Using the last weeks simulation model but with torsional spring and damping |
|   4   | Electrical systems. Operational Amplifiers. Fluid systems. Thermal Systems. Hybrid systems. | 15-24 | Pressure for the centrifugal governor system is to be produced by a circuit and piston whose equations are expected from the user |
|   5   | Transducing elements. Hydraulic actuator. Two examples on hydro-mechanical systems. DC servomotor. Electromechanical systems and hydraulic servomotor. | 25-27 |  Just colab  |
|   6   | Basic features of Control Systems. Open loop systems. Open loop thermal system. Closed loop systems. Some common controller types. Combined systems. Servo characteristics. Regulator characteristics. Sensitivity analysis. DC servomotor. | 28-39 | A vehicle that is required to stay on the target point after moving on a straight line while subjected to wind (only 1 dimensional motion and wind). Success with both open (with Steady, foreseen wind) and closed (with random wind) loops are shown to the user, user is free to wander around the code (as always :) ) and change settings. |
|   7   | General requirements for a control system. Time response of LTI systems. Impulse response. Characteristic polynomial. Characteristic equation. Poles and zeros of a transfer function. | 39-47 |  Using week 6's simulation setup but with more plots :), can be combined into one week. |
|   8   | Stability definitions and theorems. Asymptotic stability. Marginal stability. Instability. Hurwitz criterion. Routh criterion. Stability margin. | 47-53 |  Stability, marginal stability and instability of a line follower robot, which takes angular position as an input, to be observed (with self set PID values), real time plots will be provided |
|   9   | Steady state error analysis. Final Value Theorem. Methods to improve steady state characteristics of control systems. | 54-61|  Steady state characteristics to be observed by using week 8's setup (on a straight line)  |
|   10  | Step response of first order systems. Zero and nonzero To cases. Initial Value Theorem. Step response of second order systems. Overdamped systems. Critically damped systems. Underdamped and undamped systems. | 62-71 | Demonstration of criticaly damped, undamped and overdamped states on the line follower during its operation |
|   11  | Effects of pole-zero locations on system characteristics. Nonzero To cases. Degenerate second order systems. High order systems. Dominant poles. System simplification. Transient Response specifications. | 72-87 |  Just colab  |

|   13  | Bode diagrams. Constant, integral and differentiator terms. First order terms. Second order terms. Bandwidth. Resonance. Cut-off frequency. | 90-95 |   |
|   14  | Bode diagrams of higher order systems. General low frequency and high frequency characteristics of Bode plots. | 95-98 |    |
